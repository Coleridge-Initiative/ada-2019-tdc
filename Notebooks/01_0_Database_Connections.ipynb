This Python package implements the standard DBAPI Python interface for interacting with a relational database.  This is the closest you can get to connecting directly to the database in Python - there aren't any objects creating in-memory tables or layers of abstraction between you and the data.  Your Python sends SQL directly to the database and then deals row-by-row with the results.\n",

In practice, DBAPI drivers are about 95% compatible between databases and SQL for some tasks can be different from database to database, so you end up with code that can be ported between databases with a few tweaks and modifications, and then needing to test it all to make sure your SQL works."

    "`SQLAlchemy` is a higher-level Python database library that, among many other things, contains a wrapper around DBAPI that makes a subset of the DBAPI API work the same for any database `SQLAlchemy` supports (though it doesn't work exactly like DBAPI... nothing's perfect).  You can use this wrapper to write Python code that can be re-used with different databases (though  you'll have to make sure the SQL also is portable).  `SQLAlchemy` also includes advanced features like connection pooling in its implementation of DBAPI that help to make it perform better than a direct database connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just be aware that the farther you move from a direct connection, the more potential there is for things to go wrong.  Under the hood, `SQLAlchemy` is using `psycopg2` for its PostgreSQL database access, so now you have two relatively complex packages working in tandem.  If you get a particularly vexing bug running SQL with `SQLAlchemy`, in particular complex SQL or statements that update or alter the database, make sure to try that SQL with a pure DBAPI client or in the command line client to see if it is a problem with `SQLAlchemy`, not with your SQL or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQLAlchemy`'s database connection is called an engine.  To connect a `SQLAlchemy` engine to a database, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a `SQLAlchemy` connection string for your database.\n",
    "- use that string to initialize an engine and connect it to your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full connection URL for `SQLAlchemy` looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall back to our connection properties, we only need to specify host name and database.  In `SQLAlchemy`, any elements of the URL that are not needed can be omitted.  So for our database, the connection URL is:\n",

It won't occur frequently, but if you run into weird or inexplicable problems when turning SQL into DataFrames, try running the SQL using lower layers to isolate the problem.\n",

In the example below, we'll use the `pandas.read_sql()` function to read the results of an SQL query into a data frame._"
